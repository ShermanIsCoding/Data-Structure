left		   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8	// # of vertex
	visited = {0, 1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 7, 8}	// visited order
right		   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8	// # of vertex 
	visited = {0, 1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 7, 8}	// visited order

No, the visited array cannot indicate a path since between two
adjacent visited order vertices, they may not connect with each
other, like the above 7--8

Conclusion: a visited array does not show the path
