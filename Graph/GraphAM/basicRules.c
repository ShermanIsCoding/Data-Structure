dense and sparse
dense graphs:|E| is closer to V(V-1)/2
sparse graphs: |E| is closer to V

/*
Eulerian cycle and path
A connected graph has an Eulerian cycle if all its vertices have even degree
A connected graph has an Eulerian path if it has exactly 2 vertices of odd degree
and all the rest have even degree

Euler cycles and paths are mutually exclusive
a graph cannot have both an Eulerian path and cycle simultaneously
*/

/*
Hamiltonian cycle and path
remember visit every vertex exactly once
a Hamiltonian cycle means a graph must have a Hamiltonian path
